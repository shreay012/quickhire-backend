Within 10 minutes, your TPM connects with you, confirms the requirement, and assigns the right expert. It removes traditional hiring wait times that typically take days or weeks.' },
        { id: 'q2', question: 'How does the instant booking process work?', answer: 'You select the skill you need, choose the number of hours, and complete the payment. The Ai-TPM system immediately starts matching your requirement. This triggers a fast allocation cycle where your TPM validates the need, checks availability, and assigns an expert — all within minutes.' },
